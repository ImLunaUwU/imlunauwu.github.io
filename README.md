### The stuff nobody asked for.

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAWW, more stuff coming soon.

Everything you see here is also hosted on https://lunauwu.net with GitHub Pages!

Hello there! I have decided to make my work open source, so people can be inspired by my work.
Please do not copy-paste everything.


## Known Issues/ToDo:
* Scaling could be optimized for mobile on pages like /index and /downloads
* Page loads for a while if Iframe content is unreachable on /servers


### Notes:
Even though I have a very visible [AdBlock Detection section](https://github.com/ImLunaUwU/imlunauwu.github.io/tree/main/adblockdetection) on my site, it's not being used anywhere within the website itself.
It was developed entirely for another web-dev who happened to need a detector which was a bit stronger than [one from late 2020](https://www.npmjs.com/package/just-detect-adblock).
I took it as a challenge and began working on detection which didn't just look for ads being deleted (Like browser extensions do), but also checks for ad servers being able to connect, thus detecting network level blocking, such as PiHole.
If you decide to use these assets for your own project, please have some sort of credit linking to me, as I spent about 5 hours coding it lol
